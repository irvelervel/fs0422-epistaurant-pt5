// this will be a component capable of fetching live data in its mounting process
// for understanding this, we have to focus once again on the connection
// we have to establish between the interface of the component and its state (its logic)

// STEPS HAPPENING:
// 1) INITIAL RENDER() INVOKATION: this will output to the page the static parts,
// like the <h2> tag or the shell for the empyty ListGroup (empty since the state
// is still empty at this moment, [])
// 2) because we wrote a componentDidMount, that is what happens next, since
// COMPONENTDIDMOUNT FIRES AFTER THE INITIAL RENDER() INVOKATION;
// componentDidMount fetches the data (it's perfect for doing expensive operations),
// and sets the state just once (you're guaranteed of that)
// 3) because a setState just happened in the componentDidMount, RENDER() (who
// is always listening for state changes) detects it and FIRES AGAIN! will now
// leave in place the static parts, since there's no need to rewrite them, but
// when it's time to map the array for generating the list, since now we have
// filled our state with reservations, will generate the new elements of the list.
