// Routes is a container for Route components. It should delimit the
// areas of your page that you want to conditionally render upon
// URLS in the address bar! The parts of the page that are not supposed
// to be hidden on some routes, like the navbar, like a footer, should
// not be wrapped inside Routes

// with Routes you should really just delimit the parts of the interface
// you want to show on specific paths, everything OUTSIDE of it will
// ALWAYS be shown!
